<h4>  THE 0TH ASSIGNMENT   </h4> <em> Sep. 24, 2016 </em> 
<fieldset>
<p>The biggest challenge, if it even was one, was learning how to navigate throughout github and the commands in git. Even so, a bit of time allowed me to pick up on those skills fairly fast.
</p>
<p>
Things I learned from this assignment:
<ul>
<li>Some good ol' git syntax and structure</li>
<li>How to properly use git commands in the command line</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
What I already knew:
<ul>
<li>Some basic HTML syntax</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Some resources I used included quick Google searches for html syntax and the Piazza page for assignment clarifications.
